kyoani = Event.create(title: "Help KyoAni Heal", goal: 750000, description: "For decades, Kyoto Animation and their talented team of visionaries have gifted the world with animated works that have inspired and influenced countless lives around the world. In a world where nearly anything, including Japanese anime, can be reduced to a commodity, Kyoto Animation’s productions are distinguishable as some of the world’s most heartfelt, soulful and beautifully crafted works. Sentai Filmworks has been honored to have had the opportunity to represent many of those works outside Japan including K-ON!, Beyond the Boundary, and Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions. And, like all of you, we know KyoAni through those creative works. On July 18, 2019, the Kyoto Animation family was viciously and senselessly attacked. The full extent of this tragedy is only now coming into full view. More than thirty people lost their lives and scores of others were seriously injured. The purpose of this drive is to collect funds for their benefit. Our team in Japan is in communication with KyoAni representatives. Sentai Filmworks launched this drive but the movement has been propelled entirely by the generosity and kindness of people like you who have been touched by Kyoto Animation’s works over the years. The level of support and the fundraising that has been achieved so far is a testament to the positive impact KyoAni has had on the lives and the imaginations of so many around the world. We plan to end the fundraising phase of this drive on July 31. After this drive concludes, we intend to deliver 100% of the funds directly to those in need, either directly through Kyoto Animation, or through partnering with a local, Japan-based organization that can ensure that funds are delivered to the KyoAni staff and their families impacted. We are working with our contacts in Japan in coordination with KyoAni to finalize this plan. No funds will be withdrawn until the plan for aid distribution is completed and approved in cooperation with KyoAni. We will provide the details of that final plan in a follow-up post on this page.", raised_donation: 0, user_id: c.id, end_date: "2019-09-03", active: true)
brady = Event.create(title: "Cancer Teen Wedding Fund", goal: 15000, description: "Hello,My name is Brady Hunker and I would like to share a little bit about my story of finding love while battling cancer. In 2016, at the age of fifteen, I was diagnosed with Ewing Sarcoma, a form of bone cancer.  At my initial diagnosis, the tumor in my right leg was so large that I feared I would lose my leg.  At this time, my then girlfriend, Mollie Landman, always encouraged me and gave me hope in my darkest days. After months of long stays at the hospital due to chemotherapy treatments, leg salvage surgery, and radiation, I was 'cancer free' and went into remission. About a year went by, and the cancer unfortunately returned with a vengeance.  I now have numerous cancer spots in my spinal column, right arm, both shoulder blades, both upper legs, right calf, both lungs, pelvis, ribs, and possibly more that were not visible on the scans.   I have been continuing treatment for 13 months now, but none of these chemotherapies have worked as well as my treatments did in 2016. Although my prognosis isn't encouraging, my perspective on life and my priorities have drastically changed. I live every day not knowing when my last will come, and I try to make the most of the time I have left. That being said, I live my life doing what makes me happy, and surround myself with people who love and care for me more than I could ever imagine. These people are my mom and dad, sister, close friends, and the love of my life, Mollie. We met in 2014 in school, and instantly became very close. We attended school dances together, hung out in and out of school, and continued to grow closer. When I was diagnosed two years later, Mollie became my sidekick, always by my side, ready to fight this battle with me. She would get me things in the hospital, spend time with me while I was getting chemo, bring me bags to throw up in,  practically do anything I needed.  Mollie selflessly helped me on my most difficult days, and was always there to make me smile. I honestly cannot imagine going through this battle without her, and I couldn't be more thankful for such an incredible girl coming into my life and staying to help me through the toughest battle I could imagine. One night, Mollie and I were having a deep conversation, which is common for us, about regrets in life. We posed the question, 'If we heard the worst news, if I was given a week to live, and then I would pass away,  what would I regret not doing?'' The only thing that we could come up with is getting married. In a world full of possibilities and opportunity, if I lost my fight, I would only regret not marrying Mollie. We don't know when that day will come, or if it ever will, but what we do know is that we don't have a reason to wait. I proposed to Mollie over Easter weekend, and she said YES!! Due to my diagnosis, we want to get married soon, as we don't know what the future holds, and want to spend as long married as we can. Therefore, we plan to get married over the summer! Now, here is where I need all of your help!  I have not been able to work or save up money because of my fight against cancer, but I want the love of my life to have the wedding she always dreamed of. I am asking you to donate to our wedding to help make the day a dream come true for both Mollie and I. Any donations will go towards food, venue, clothes, transportation, cake, our honeymoon, and anything else that comes up. Thank you so much for reading through our story and helping in any way that you can!", raised_donation: 0, user_id: d.id, end_date: "2020-02-12", active: true)
