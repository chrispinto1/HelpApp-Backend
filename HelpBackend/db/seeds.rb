test = Campaign.create(title: "Jarheads MC - Victims and Families support", goal: 10000, description: "**Update 3** - I want to thank you on behalf of Jarheads MC for the continued love and support. Money coming in from kids’ lemonade stands, and ice cream shops across the country. Businesses we have never met or dealt with have reached out, and while we mourn our fallen, it's a blessing to know that such caring does still exist today.  Thank you so much! The legal process will likely be long, and we don't know how much financial help we can receive from those actions, so every bit helps. There are medical expenses, and numerous other burdens that come from the loss of a loved one.

One other quick note. We will be at Gillette Stadium Saturday July 13th from 12pm-5pm and we will have shirts and more. If you are able, we would love to see you there.

**Update 2** - If you are unable to donate through GoFundMe, please use our PO box. Mail To: Jarheads MC PO Box 362 Marlboro, MA. 01752

**Update** - Thank you all for your continued support, we would like to share an update. The driver of the vehicle has been arrested and charged with 7 counts of negligent homicide, and will be arraigned tomorrow, June 25th at 1:30pm at 55 School St. Lancaster, New Hampshire.

On Friday, June 21st 2019 Jarheads MC was riding to a charity event at the local American Legion in Gorham, New Hampshire Post #82. Our pack was struck by an oncoming vehicle and we lost 5 patch holders and 2 supporters, and many others are injured. Our club and the families are going to need help and we cannot do it alone. I am pleading with you all, please do what you can, and 100% of the funds raised will go where it is needed to help ease some of the financial burden left behind after this tragic event. Jarheads MC has always been about helping veterans and their families. Please help us now and give what you can. Everything you can do is appreciated. We are strong enough to get through this, but we ask for and need your support.

Names and conditions of all will not be shared at this time as we are still being impacted by news as it arrives. We will be in New Hampshire the rest of the weekend supporting our friends and families.

jake = Campaign.create(title: "Brian's Medical Bills", goal: 100000, description: "On Saturday July 20, 2019 the Wisconsin Rapids area was hit with severe storms that caused major damage throughout town.  My husband Brian Ortner is a lineman for the local telephone  company and was called out to work.  As I understand it, he was clearing debris off of telephone lines when the limb swung and hit him in the back.  Luckily the line he was trying to cut it off of kept the tree from completely pinning him to the ground or we most likely would have lost him.  He immediately could not feel his legs.  He was rushed to Marshfield by ambulance where we learned of his devastating injuries.  He has an unstable T8 (thoracic) burst fracture that severed his spinal cord.  He has a left femoral neck (hip) fracture, C6 (cervical) spinous process fracture, T9 & T10 transverse process fractures, left rib fractures 6-10, and the 7th right rib.  Currently he feels nothing from the chest down and that will not change.  The neurosurgeon told us that we are lucky that he is even alive.  People with that severe of injury usually do not make it to the hospital, which is what makes Brian's surgery so risky.  The bone of his spine is pressing on his aorta (the major blood vessel off your heart).  He went into surgery this morning around 10am to stabilize his spine.  We are told the surgery will take 8-10hrs.  With that surgery comes the risk of his paralysis moving up to affect his diaphragm.  If that is the case he will likely be sedated with a breathing tube for the next few days with the hope that the swelling would go down and he will be able to breath on his own again.  He will also have an NG tube in his nose.  The good news is they told us it is VERY unlikely that he would lose the use of his arms after this surgery.  I am so greatful for that!  It sounds like we will be here for the next 2-3 weeks and after that I need to try and get into a spinal cord injury rehab center.  So far we have been told Denver is the best one.  The reality of our situation is that our lives are forever changed from this moment on.  The home that we have lived in for the past 15yrs, where we brought our babies home to will no longer be a home we can have.  It is an old home that has 3 levels and too narrow of doorways for his wheelchair.  And the icing on the cake is that today (surgery day) is our son Bennett's 8th birthday.  This is not at all where we imagined we would be, but here we are.  And I am sure there are many things in the future we can not foresee.  Please pray for Brian today for him to make it out of this risky surgery safely, and pray for us all in the future as we learn to deal with this tragedy.  Thank you for all of the thoughts, prayers, and offers to help.  I don't like to ask for it, but we will need it.   -Amy", raised_donation: 0, user_id: b.id, end_date: "2019-07-09", active: true, image: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/67636/rose-blue-flower-rose-blooms-67636.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500")

Ashok is being treated for Traumatic brain injury, ribs fracture, spinal injury and shoulder fracture.We are praying for their speedy recovery and they are in dire need of financial support as Ashok is an international student with no immediate family in USA and Soujanya is a mom of 8yr old kid, so we are making arrangements to bring their families to USA in order to take care of them while they are bed ridden.

feed_kids = Campaign.create(title: "Help Me Feed Hungry Kids This Summer", goal: 50000, description: "Hi there! My name is Jordyn, I'm 11 years old, and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. This summer, I'm raising money to help feed hungry children in my community because I think everyone deserves a full belly. Last year, I noticed one of my classmates didn’t have lunch so I started sharing my snacks with them. Soon I started packing an extra lunch and gave them an extra sandwich, snacks, and some extra fruit. They were so appreciative! This got me thinking that if one student didn’t have lunch, there are probably others that didn’t have lunch too. It made me really sad because I don’t want any of my classmates to be hungry. That day I decided I wanted to do something to help. I originally thought of hosting a food drive but I didn’t want anyone to feel embarrassed having to pick up food. Instead, I teamed up with an awesome local organization called Three Square and we put on a virtual food drive. Our first fundraiser last winter raised enough money to help supply over 6,000 meals to hungry peers in my community. This summer, I knew I wanted to raise the bar. Summer is the hungriest time of year for my friends who rely on school meals for breakfast and lunch. This time around, I’m trying to raise enough money to help provide even more meals so that my peers and friends don't have to worry about anything but having fun this summer! $1 helps provide 3 meals for people in need so if we work together we can make a huge impact. Goal #1: $2,000 will help me provide 6,000 meals Goal #2: $5,000 will help me provide 15,000 meals Goal #3: $10,000 will help me provide 30,000 meals I really wish that i could feed every kid in the whole entire world, but I feel like this is a really good start! Want to join me in making a difference? I'm raising money to benefit Three Square and any donation will help make an impact.

On March 5th Onahan Elementary School suffered a fire in the main school building.  We are incredibly grateful there were no injuries but our teachers, staff and students are devastated. Classrooms were emptied.  Students were riding buses to alternate schools daily.  Teachers with 25 years of materials will be starting from scratch.  We need help from our amazing community to rebuild Onahan. The Onahan pride is strong! We have communicated with Chicago Public Schools and they are fully committed to funding the replacement of all instructional materials, technology, and furniture that was damaged. They are already working with the CPS Warehouse and vendors to secure replacements. We thank CPS for the support that they have provided in getting our children back to Onahan as fast as possible.  We’d also like to thank the workers who have put in extra hours to begin restocking the school. While this is a large step in the rebuilding process, we hope to replace the heart of Onahan as well. No fundraising dollars will go towards completing the work that CPS has committed to providing. Proceeds from this fundraiser will go towards providing replacements of the materials that made our classrooms feel like home to our kids.  The Onahan teachers’ have lost almost all of their personal items that were accumulated over years and even decades. It’s these things that made the walls of Onahan burst with pride. The Onahan administration will work with the Friends of Onahan to provide a list of these necessities that will then be purchased with the funds raised.
The kindness and generosity of the Onahan community and its partners is greatly appreciated by all.", raised_donation: 0, user_id: a.id, end_date: "2019-07-09", active: true, image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/2009-0617-Ontonagon-school.jpg")

Autumn currently is one of my beloved employees, she is behind a lot of the beautiful pictures you see, she loves dogs as if they are her own.

Time is of the essence so if we can not raise at least half in the next few hours we can not do the surgery and we will not watch her suffer.  If we do not receive enough donations, you will receive your donations back. Or if the surgery or treatment cost less, you will receive your donation back or we can forward it to another animal rescue. We are currently starting the rest of the baseline work up that she needs prior to surgery. No amount is too small. Thank you so much.

kyoani = Campaign.create(title: "Help KyoAni Heal", goal: 750000, description: "For decades, Kyoto Animation and their talented team of visionaries have gifted the world with animated works that have inspired and influenced countless lives around the world. In a world where nearly anything, including Japanese anime, can be reduced to a commodity, Kyoto Animation’s productions are distinguishable as some of the world’s most heartfelt, soulful and beautifully crafted works. Sentai Filmworks has been honored to have had the opportunity to represent many of those works outside Japan including K-ON!, Beyond the Boundary, and Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions. And, like all of you, we know KyoAni through those creative works. On July 18, 2019, the Kyoto Animation family was viciously and senselessly attacked. The full extent of this tragedy is only now coming into full view. More than thirty people lost their lives and scores of others were seriously injured. The purpose of this drive is to collect funds for their benefit. Our team in Japan is in communication with KyoAni representatives. Sentai Filmworks launched this drive but the movement has been propelled entirely by the generosity and kindness of people like you who have been touched by Kyoto Animation’s works over the years. The level of support and the fundraising that has been achieved so far is a testament to the positive impact KyoAni has had on the lives and the imaginations of so many around the world. We plan to end the fundraising phase of this drive on July 31. After this drive concludes, we intend to deliver 100% of the funds directly to those in need, either directly through Kyoto Animation, or through partnering with a local, Japan-based organization that can ensure that funds are delivered to the KyoAni staff and their families impacted. We are working with our contacts in Japan in coordination with KyoAni to finalize this plan. No funds will be withdrawn until the plan for aid distribution is completed and approved in cooperation with KyoAni. We will provide the details of that final plan in a follow-up post on this page.", raised_donation: 0, user_id: b.id, end_date: "2019-09-03", active: true, image: "https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/cc_iStock-478639870_16x9.jpg?itok=1-jMc4Xv")
brady = Campaign.create(title: "Cancer Teen Wedding Fund", goal: 15000, description: "Hello,My name is Brady Hunker and I would like to share a little bit about my story of finding love while battling cancer. In 2016, at the age of fifteen, I was diagnosed with Ewing Sarcoma, a form of bone cancer.  At my initial diagnosis, the tumor in my right leg was so large that I feared I would lose my leg.  At this time, my then girlfriend, Mollie Landman, always encouraged me and gave me hope in my darkest days. After months of long stays at the hospital due to chemotherapy treatments, leg salvage surgery, and radiation, I was 'cancer free' and went into remission. About a year went by, and the cancer unfortunately returned with a vengeance.  I now have numerous cancer spots in my spinal column, right arm, both shoulder blades, both upper legs, right calf, both lungs, pelvis, ribs, and possibly more that were not visible on the scans.   I have been continuing treatment for 13 months now, but none of these chemotherapies have worked as well as my treatments did in 2016. Although my prognosis isn't encouraging, my perspective on life and my priorities have drastically changed. I live every day not knowing when my last will come, and I try to make the most of the time I have left. That being said, I live my life doing what makes me happy, and surround myself with people who love and care for me more than I could ever imagine. These people are my mom and dad, sister, close friends, and the love of my life, Mollie. We met in 2014 in school, and instantly became very close. We attended school dances together, hung out in and out of school, and continued to grow closer. When I was diagnosed two years later, Mollie became my sidekick, always by my side, ready to fight this battle with me. She would get me things in the hospital, spend time with me while I was getting chemo, bring me bags to throw up in,  practically do anything I needed.  Mollie selflessly helped me on my most difficult days, and was always there to make me smile. I honestly cannot imagine going through this battle without her, and I couldn't be more thankful for such an incredible girl coming into my life and staying to help me through the toughest battle I could imagine. One night, Mollie and I were having a deep conversation, which is common for us, about regrets in life. We posed the question, 'If we heard the worst news, if I was given a week to live, and then I would pass away,  what would I regret not doing?'' The only thing that we could come up with is getting married. In a world full of possibilities and opportunity, if I lost my fight, I would only regret not marrying Mollie. We don't know when that day will come, or if it ever will, but what we do know is that we don't have a reason to wait. I proposed to Mollie over Easter weekend, and she said YES!! Due to my diagnosis, we want to get married soon, as we don't know what the future holds, and want to spend as long married as we can. Therefore, we plan to get married over the summer! Now, here is where I need all of your help!  I have not been able to work or save up money because of my fight against cancer, but I want the love of my life to have the wedding she always dreamed of. I am asking you to donate to our wedding to help make the day a dream come true for both Mollie and I. Any donations will go towards food, venue, clothes, transportation, cake, our honeymoon, and anything else that comes up.
