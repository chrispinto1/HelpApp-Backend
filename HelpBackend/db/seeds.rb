Just a minute away from Ashok's house on Bethel road (Columbus, Ohio), they met with an unfortunate accident involving four vehicles. They were severely injured and taken to Riverside Methodist Hospital and have been under critical care. Soujanya & Ashok both had head injuries and have been in critical condition since then. Nikhil was observed with some injuries.

Ashok is being treated for Traumatic brain injury, ribs fracture, spinal injury and shoulder fracture.We are praying for their speedy recovery and they are in dire need of financial support as Ashok is an international student with no immediate family in USA and Soujanya is a mom of 8yr old kid, so we are making arrangements to bring their families to USA in order to take care of them while they are bed ridden. They need funds to cover co-insurance and expenses that are not covered by insurance as we are looking at months of intensive care and therapy as a result of brain injury. They strongly need our prayers and financial support to get back to normalcy. Please share this information with your family and friends and let's unite to help them.

feed_kids = Campaign.create(title: "Help Me Feed Hungry Kids This Summer", goal: 50000, description: "Hi there! My name is Jordyn, I'm 11 years old, and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. This summer, I'm raising money to help feed hungry children in my community because I think everyone deserves a full belly. Last year, I noticed one of my classmates didn’t have lunch so I started sharing my snacks with them. Soon I started packing an extra lunch and gave them an extra sandwich, snacks, and some extra fruit. They were so appreciative! This got me thinking that if one student didn’t have lunch, there are probably others that didn’t have lunch too. It made me really sad because I don’t want any of my classmates to be hungry. That day I decided I wanted to do something to help. I originally thought of hosting a food drive but I didn’t want anyone to feel embarrassed having to pick up food. Instead, I teamed up with an awesome local organization called Three Square and we put on a virtual food drive. Our first fundraiser last winter raised enough money to help supply over 6,000 meals to hungry peers in my community. This summer, I knew I wanted to raise the bar. Summer is the hungriest time of year for my friends who rely on school meals for breakfast and lunch. This time around, I’m trying to raise enough money to help provide even more meals so that my peers and friends don't have to worry about anything but having fun this summer! $1 helps provide 3 meals for people in need so if we work together we can make a huge impact. Goal #1: $2,000 will help me provide 6,000 meals Goal #2: $5,000 will help me provide 15,000 meals Goal #3: $10,000 will help me provide 30,000 meals I really wish that i could feed every kid in the whole entire world, but I feel like this is a really good start! Want to join me in making a difference? I'm raising money to benefit Three Square and any donation will help make an impact. Thanks in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me!", raised_donation: 0, user_id: c.id, end_date: "2019-07-09", active: true, image: "https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/40713796_1563469569560933_r.jpeg")
rebuild_school = Campaign.create(title: "Return the Roar- Rebuilding Onahan School", goal: 50000, description: "Our hearts are HUGE but our walls and shelves are empty.  On March 5th Onahan Elementary School suffered a fire in the main school building.  We are incredibly grateful there were no injuries but our teachers, staff and students are devastated. Classrooms were emptied.  Students were riding buses to alternate schools daily.  Teachers with 25 years of materials will be starting from scratch.  We need help from our amazing community to rebuild Onahan. The Onahan pride is strong! We have communicated with Chicago Public Schools and they are fully committed to funding the replacement of all instructional materials, technology, and furniture that was damaged. They are already working with the CPS Warehouse and vendors to secure replacements. We thank CPS for the support that they have provided in getting our children back to Onahan as fast as possible.  We’d also like to thank the workers who have put in extra hours to begin restocking the school. While this is a large step in the rebuilding process, we hope to replace the heart of Onahan as well. No fundraising dollars will go towards completing the work that CPS has committed to providing. Proceeds from this fundraiser will go towards providing replacements of the materials that made our classrooms feel like home to our kids.  The Onahan teachers’ have lost almost all of their personal items that were accumulated over years and even decades. It’s these things that made the walls of Onahan burst with pride. The Onahan administration will work with the Friends of Onahan to provide a list of these necessities that will then be purchased with the funds raised.
The kindness and generosity of the Onahan community and its partners is greatly appreciated by all.", raised_donation: 0, user_id: d.id, end_date: "2019-07-09", active: true, image: "https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/40713796_1563469569560933_r.jpeg")
chloe = Campaign.create(title: "Chloe", goal: 10000, description: "Chloe has been involved a very traumatic/severe injury in which she received 13+ broken ribs.  She currently is stable enough for the surgery which is the only way she can survive.
Autumn currently is one of my beloved employees, she is behind a lot of the beautiful pictures you see, she loves dogs as if they are her own. I can help with a chunk of the cost but we need help with the rest. Time is of the essence so if we can not raise at least half in the next few hours we can not do the surgery and we will not watch her suffer.  If we do not receive enough donations, you will receive your donations back. Or if the surgery or treatment cost less, you will receive your donation back or we can forward it to another animal rescue. We are currently starting the rest of the baseline work up that she needs prior to surgery. No amount is too small. Thank you so much.

kyoani = Campaign.create(title: "Help KyoAni Heal", goal: 750000, description: "For decades, Kyoto Animation and their talented team of visionaries have gifted the world with animated works that have inspired and influenced countless lives around the world. In a world where nearly anything, including Japanese anime, can be reduced to a commodity, Kyoto Animation’s productions are distinguishable as some of the world’s most heartfelt, soulful and beautifully crafted works. Sentai Filmworks has been honored to have had the opportunity to represent many of those works outside Japan including K-ON!, Beyond the Boundary, and Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions. And, like all of you, we know KyoAni through those creative works. On July 18, 2019, the Kyoto Animation family was viciously and senselessly attacked. The full extent of this tragedy is only now coming into full view. More than thirty people lost their lives and scores of others were seriously injured. The purpose of this drive is to collect funds for their benefit. Our team in Japan is in communication with KyoAni representatives. Sentai Filmworks launched this drive but the movement has been propelled entirely by the generosity and kindness of people like you who have been touched by Kyoto Animation’s works over the years. The level of support and the fundraising that has been achieved so far is a testament to the positive impact KyoAni has had on the lives and the imaginations of so many around the world. We plan to end the fundraising phase of this drive on July 31. After this drive concludes, we intend to deliver 100% of the funds directly to those in need, either directly through Kyoto Animation, or through partnering with a local, Japan-based organization that can ensure that funds are delivered to the KyoAni staff and their families impacted. We are working with our contacts in Japan in coordination with KyoAni to finalize this plan. No funds will be withdrawn until the plan for aid distribution is completed and approved in cooperation with KyoAni. We will provide the details of that final plan in a follow-up post on this page.", raised_donation: 0, user_id: c.id, end_date: "2019-09-03", active: true, image: "https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/40713796_1563469569560933_r.jpeg")
brady = Campaign.create(title: "Cancer Teen Wedding Fund", goal: 15000, description: "Hello,My name is Brady Hunker and I would like to share a little bit about my story of finding love while battling cancer. In 2016, at the age of fifteen, I was diagnosed with Ewing Sarcoma, a form of bone cancer.  At my initial diagnosis, the tumor in my right leg was so large that I feared I would lose my leg.  At this time, my then girlfriend, Mollie Landman, always encouraged me and gave me hope in my darkest days. After months of long stays at the hospital due to chemotherapy treatments, leg salvage surgery, and radiation, I was 'cancer free' and went into remission. About a year went by, and the cancer unfortunately returned with a vengeance.  I now have numerous cancer spots in my spinal column, right arm, both shoulder blades, both upper legs, right calf, both lungs, pelvis, ribs, and possibly more that were not visible on the scans.   I have been continuing treatment for 13 months now, but none of these chemotherapies have worked as well as my treatments did in 2016. Although my prognosis isn't encouraging, my perspective on life and my priorities have drastically changed. I live every day not knowing when my last will come, and I try to make the most of the time I have left. That being said, I live my life doing what makes me happy, and surround myself with people who love and care for me more than I could ever imagine. These people are my mom and dad, sister, close friends, and the love of my life, Mollie. We met in 2014 in school, and instantly became very close. We attended school dances together, hung out in and out of school, and continued to grow closer. When I was diagnosed two years later, Mollie became my sidekick, always by my side, ready to fight this battle with me. She would get me things in the hospital, spend time with me while I was getting chemo, bring me bags to throw up in,  practically do anything I needed.  Mollie selflessly helped me on my most difficult days, and was always there to make me smile. I honestly cannot imagine going through this battle without her, and I couldn't be more thankful for such an incredible girl coming into my life and staying to help me through the toughest battle I could imagine. One night, Mollie and I were having a deep conversation, which is common for us, about regrets in life. We posed the question, 'If we heard the worst news, if I was given a week to live, and then I would pass away,  what would I regret not doing?'' The only thing that we could come up with is getting married. In a world full of possibilities and opportunity, if I lost my fight, I would only regret not marrying Mollie. We don't know when that day will come, or if it ever will, but what we do know is that we don't have a reason to wait. I proposed to Mollie over Easter weekend, and she said YES!! Due to my diagnosis, we want to get married soon, as we don't know what the future holds, and want to spend as long married as we can. Therefore, we plan to get married over the summer! Now, here is where I need all of your help!  I have not been able to work or save up money because of my fight against cancer, but I want the love of my life to have the wedding she always dreamed of. I am asking you to donate to our wedding to help make the day a dream come true for both Mollie and I. Any donations will go towards food, venue, clothes, transportation, cake, our honeymoon, and anything else that comes up.
